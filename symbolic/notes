popcount comparator cascade, but with accumulated carry chains




Neural net (concrete):

for i in range(0, 26):
    s = x[260 + i] + -1 * x[224 + i]
    out[198 + i] = s if s > 0 else 0.0 # ReLu

Neural Net (abstract):
yN = relu(-1*groupA + 1*groupB + 1*y(N-1) + 1.0)

SSA:
y221 = popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111)
y222 = y221 or (popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111))
y223 = y222 or (popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111))

Binary SSA (part 1)
y221 = (B > A) at coarse granularity
y222 = y221 || (tie broken at finer granularity)

C code logic:

l[192..224] = l[260..286] + -1 * l[224..250]
            = l[260..286] & !l[224..250]
resembles something like??
l ^= sp2[(t >> 24) & 0x3F]; \


Each output neuron matches:

out = relu(popcount(B) - popcount(A) + sum(carry_terms))

So it's computing:

yN = (popcount(B) > popcount(A)) or carry_in₁ or carry_in₂ ...

Where carry_in_k is a previous yM.

This is a multi-stage OR-reduction comparator cascade. Each level accumulates more signals showing B > A in any previous or current slice.





These three neurons implement a **multi-bit comparator cascade**:  
They compare two 56-bit values bitwise (x56..x111 vs x112..x167), and use a **priority encoding** scheme to decide **which is greater**, one bit at a time.

## 🔍 Breakdown

Each neuron:

```
yN = relu(-1*groupA + 1*groupB + 1*y(N-1) + 1.0)
```

- **Group A**: x56–x111 (56 bits)
- **Group B**: x112–x167 (56 bits)
- `y221` compares A vs B and writes a result
- `y222` uses `y221` + its own comparison
- `y223` uses `y222` + its own comparison

### This is:
```python
y221 = popcount(B) - popcount(A) > -1
y222 = y221 or (popcount(B) - popcount(A) > -1)
y223 = y222 or (popcount(B) - popcount(A) > -1)
```

Each layer accumulates "B > A" signals and propagates them forward — a **bitwise greater-than comparison unrolled** into ReLU logic.

## ✅ Label suggestion:

```python
y221 = popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111)
y222 = y221 or (popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111))
y223 = y222 or (popcount(x112..x167) > popcount(x56..x111))
```

Or more clearly:
```python
y221 = (B > A) at coarse granularity
y222 = y221 || (tie broken at finer granularity)
...
```

This structure is used to build comparators, sorters, or selectors in logic circuits.
