I want you to explain to me how you would convert this C logic expression down to a neural network of Wx+b and Relu.

Expression:
l ^= sp2[(t >> 24) & 0x3F]; into a neural network expression. 

Expression breakdown (C-wise):
shifting bits
    t >> 24

applying a mask
    & 0x3f

indexing an array
    sp2
    this is an array of masks

XORing
    0 xor 0 = 1
    0 xor 1 = 0
    1 xor 0 = 1
    1 xor 1 = 0

Abstract layers (there may be some intermediate missing):

code:
- function calling
- loops
- bit operators

symbolic evaluator

symbolic trace
- list of [operation, input, output]. operations include [logic ops not and or nor xor, bitwise ops, identity (setting constants)
- Flattened assignments, no dependencies

neural network
- layers (linear(weights, bias), relu)






# Layer 3: One-Hot Encoded Lookup
# Given the 6-bit binary vector (mask_bits), we compute its integer index and then
# perform a lookup using one-hot multiplication with sp2.
def layer_lookup(mask_bits: np.ndarray, sp2: np.ndarray) -> float:
    # Convert the 6-bit binary vector into an integer index.
    biases = [0]
    for i in range(6):
        # Assume mask_bits[0] is the MSB.
        index = index * 2 + int(mask_bits[i])
    
    # Now simulate a one-hot encoded lookup:
    # For each of the 64 entries, multiply sp2[i] by the one-hot value.
    lookup_val = 0.0
    for i in range(64):
        # one_hot_val is 1.0 when i equals the computed index, otherwise 0.0.
        one_hot_val = 1.0 if i == index else 0.0
        # Multiply and accumulate using only + and *.
        lookup_val = lookup_val + sp2[i] * one_hot_val
    return lookup_val




# Layer 4: XOR Operation
# Using the provided gate table, we implement XOR as:
#   output = ReLU(-l - lookup_val + 1)




XORing
    0 xor 0 = 1
    0 xor 1 = 0
    1 xor 0 = 1

# Layer 3: One-Hot Decoder Lookup
# Input: x is a 6-element vector (the output from the mask layer).
# Each of 64 neurons computes a linear combination over x:
#    s = sum_j (x[j] * W[i,j]) + bias[i]
# then fires: y[i] = ReLU(s) (exactly one neuron fires for a valid one-hot).
# Finally, its output is multiplied by sp2[i] (the lookup table constant).
def layer_lookup(x: np.ndarray, sp2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    weights, biases = get_lookup_weights_and_biases()
    y = np.empty(64, dtype=np.float32)
    for i in range(64):
        s = 0.0
        s = s + x[0] * weights[i, 0]
        s = s + x[1] * weights[i, 1]
        s = s + x[2] * weights[i, 2]
        s = s + x[3] * weights[i, 3]
        s = s + x[4] * weights[i, 4]
        s = s + x[5] * weights[i, 5]
        s = s + biases[i]
        # Only one ReLU per neuron is allowed.

    return y






    # weight = 2*bit - 1 
    # weight = +1 if bit==1, -1 if bit==0

    # in essence:
    # y[0] = 
        # select 1 bit of x using weights (1,-1,-1,-1,-1)
        # multiply by sp[0]
        # subtract all bits of x minus 0.5 to only activate for one bit
    # do this for all y[0] to y[64] (size of sp)

        # We can't do this! Because we can only do Wx. we cannot refer to x.
        # y[i] = x[0] * x[0 + i] + x[1] * x[1 + i] + x[2] * x[2 + i] + x[3] * x[3 + i] + x[4] * x[4 + i] + x[5] * x[5 + i]
        
        





layer_shift manually selects bits 24â€“31.
# in: 32; out: 8
for i in range(8):
    y[i] = x[24 + i]

layer_mask extracts the lower 6 bits.
# in: 8, out: 6
for i in range(6):
    # select lower 6 bits (indices 2 to 7)
    y[i] = x[2 + i]







layer_xor computes r4 = l xor r3
# in: 2; out: 1
y[0] = -1 * x[0] - x[1] + 1






layer_xor applies the XOR operation as a linear function followed by ReLU.
