This code is essentially decomposing a 232‑bit input into multiple “bit slices” that are processed in parallel using fixed bit‐masks and shifts. In effect, it’s implementing a table–lookup or hash–like operation where each perceptron:

Selects one bit from each of several fixed offsets (e.g. indices 
i
i, 
i
+
56
i+56, 
i
+
112
i+112, 
i
+
168
i+168).
Applies specific weights that are powers of two (or negatives thereof), equivalent to bit shifts.
Combines these to form an integer that is then thresholded by a ReLU (i.e. if the sum is negative, output 0).
This pattern is reminiscent of bit–wise extraction and recombination—like a digital circuit that “masks” and shifts bits to compute a hash or checksum
